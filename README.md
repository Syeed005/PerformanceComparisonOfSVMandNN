# Performance Comparison of SVM & NN
Computational efficiency, testing & accuracy and performance on small datasets are measured with SVM and deep neural network classifiers. Also plot graph showing the time taken to evaluate, train and testing dataset both for SVM and NN classifiers.

# Observaton
SVM performs better on smaller datasets whereas neural networks performs better on large datasets.
